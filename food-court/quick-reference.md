## Objective

Score the most points by cooking and serving recipes and playing Drink, Event, and Utensil Cards to 
serve customers and meet their bonus requirements.

## Setup

1. Deck Selection: Each player selects a restaurant deck.
2. Customers:
    - Combine all Customer Cards into one deck; shuffle.
    - Deal 1 face‑up customer to each player; reveal 2 face‑up to the center as the central queue.
    - Place the rest as a face‑down draw pile.
3. Your Station:
    - Place your Ability Card in front of you.
    - Place your deck face down as a draw pile and draw 6 cards (hand limit).
    - Reserve space to the right of the Ability Card for the discard pile and End Condition cards.
    - Above the Ability Card, place your prepared ingredients and cooked recipes, utensils and 
    drinks.
    - Above that, maintain your personal customer queue.
4. First Player: choose randomly and start the game.

## Turn Structure

The game is played in rounds where each round consists of all players taking a turn clockwise.
On your turn:

1. Attract 1 customer from the central queue to your queue (refill the central queue if possible).
2. Play up to 3 cards (play limit) to do any of the actions below:
    - Prepare Ingredients: put ingredient cards in play
    - Cook Recipes: cook recipes using prepared ingredients
    - Trigger Events: play Complaint/Promotion/Discount cards to interact with the customer queues.
    - Serve Drinks: put drink cards into play by discarding the cards used meet their requirements.
3. Serve: Move as many customers to your scoring pile as served as possible based on the cooked 
   recipes' serve value and the customers' base value. Or if a drink card was put into play (or its
   requirement is met), move all customers to the scoring pile.
4. At the end of your turn: If your queue is empty draw 1 customer from the central queue. If full
   pass your queue's leftmost customer to the player on your left as rightmost in theirs.

Outside your turn, you can discard up to 3 cards then draw to your hand limit.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Ingredient cards represent the various components needed to cook recipes. They come in three
categories:

- **Primary Ingredients** – Required in every recipe.
- **Secondary Ingredients** – Required in normal and hard recipes.
- **Optional Ingredients** – Can be added to any recipe (but max 1 per recipe) to increase its serve
  value by 1.

### Recipe Cards

Recipe cards represent dishes that players can cook and serve to attract customers. They vary in 
complexity and serve value:

- **Easy:** Requires 1 Primary Ingredient — serve value 1.
- **Normal:** Requires 1 Primary + 1 Secondary Ingredient — serve value 2.
- **Hard:** Requires 1 Primary + 2 Secondary Ingredients — serve value 4.

### Drink Cards

Drinks require no ingredients and can be played when their requirement is in place. When played, 
move all customers from your queue to your scoring pile. Drink Cards stay in play and
re‑trigger this effect each time their requirement is met.

### Event Cards

Event Cards provide one-time strategic effects that can impact any queue (including the central
queue). They are:

- Complaint: Discard 1 customer from any queue.
- Promotion: Swap 2 customers between any two queues.
- Discount: Move 1 customer from your own or the central queue to your scoring pile without covering
  its base value.

### Customer Cards

Customers show a base value (1–4) as a serving requirement and a bonus value that scores along with
the base value if the bonus requirements are met. Queue limit is 2 (3 if the Tableware utensil is
in play). At the start of your turn attract 1 customer from the central queue; if your queue empties
during your turn, draw 1 from the central queue at the end. Also at the end of your turn: if your 
queue is at its limit, pass your leftmost customer to the player on the left as their rightmost.

### Ability Card

Each deck includes an Ability Card that outlines your deck’s unique ability, its End Condition, and
how to track it.

Special abilities are evaluated only from served recipes not cooked ones.
A card cannot participate in more than one special ability occurrence.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the round in which a player completes their End Condition or the customer deck 
is emptied. After the game ends, sum Victory Points (VP) from your served customers: each customer 
scores its base value plus its bonus value if its bonus requirements are met. Highest total VP wins.

Tiebreaker: the player who most recently cooked a real-life meal wins.
