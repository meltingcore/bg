## Objective

Players aim to score the most Victory Points (VP) by cooking and serving recipes and playing drink, 
event and utensil cards to attract customers and cover their requirements.

## Setup

1. **Deck Selection:** Each player selects a restaurant deck.
2. **Customers:**
    - Combine all customer cards into one deck; shuffle.
    - Deal 1 face‑up customer to each player; reveal 2 face‑up to the center.
    - Place the rest as a face‑down draw pile.
3. **Player Station Setup:**
    - Place the **Ability Card** in front of the player.
    - Place your deck face down as draw pile and draw 6 cards (hand limit).
    - Reserve space to the right of the Ability Card for the **discard pile** and **End Condition
      Cards**.
    - Above the Ability Card, players will place their **prepared ingredients and cooked recipes**.
    - Above that, players will maintain their **personal customer queue**.
4. Choose **First Player:** randomly and start the game.

## Turn Structure

Game is played in rounds where 1 round consists of all players taking their turns clockwise.  
Each player turn consists of the following:

1. Take 1 customer from the central queue and add it to your queue (refill center if possible).
2. Play up to 3 cards (play limit) to do any of the actions below:
    - Cook: prepare ingredients and cook recipes.
    - Drinks: play to directly attract all customers from your queue. drinks stay in play and 
    activate (attract all from queue) each time their requirement is met.
    - Utensils: play if you have 2 cooked recipes with its icon; utensils stay in play for their
    ongoing effects.
    - Events: play Complaint/Promotion/Discount to interact with the customer queues.
3. Serve: allocate cooked recipes to customers based on their values; fully covered customers are 
attracted.
4. If your queue becomes empty during your turn, draw 1 customer at the end of it. If still at queue
limit at the end of the turn instead, pass your leftmost customer to the player on your left.

Outside your turn, you can discard up to 3 cards then draw to your hand limit.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Ingredient cards represent the various components needed to cook recipes. They come in three
categories:

- **Primary Ingredients** – Required in every recipe.
- **Secondary Ingredients** – Required in normal and hard recipes.
- **Optional Ingredients** – Can be added to any recipe to grant +1 VP when served.

### Recipe Cards

Recipe cards represent dishes that players can cook and serve to attract customers. They vary in 
complexity and potential:

- **Easy:** Requires 1 Primary Ingredient — base value 1.
- **Normal:** Requires 1 Primary + 1 Secondary Ingredient — base value 2.
- **Hard:** Requires 1 Primary + 2 Secondary Ingredients — base value 4.

### Drink Cards

Drinks require no ingredients and can be played when their requirement is in place. When played, 
attract all customers from the player's queue. Drink cards stay in play and activate (attract all
customers from the player's queue) each time their requirement is met.

### Event Cards

Event cards provide one-time strategic effects that can impact any player's queue. They are:

- **Complaint:** Discard 1 customer from any queue.
- **Promotion:** Swap 2 customers between any two players’ queues.
- **Discount:** Attract 1 customer from your own queue without serving.

### Customer Cards

Customers show base value (1–4) to attract in a single turn and extra requirement icons for bonus
value at end of game. Queue limit is 2 (Tableware → 3). At start of your turn take 1 from center; if
your queue empties during your turn, draw 1 at the end. Also at the end of turn: if queue is at 
limit, pass leftmost to the left.

### Ability Card

Each deck includes an ability card that outlines the deck’s unique ability, its end condition and 
how to track it.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the round in which a player completes their end condition or the customer deck
is emptied. Highest total score from attracted customers (base + extra points) wins. 

**Tiebreaker:** The player who most recently cooked a real-life meal wins.
