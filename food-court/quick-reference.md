## Objective

Score the most Victory Points (VP). All VP come from served customers: each customer scores its base
value (1–4) plus its bonus value if you meet the depicted bonus requirements at game end.

## Setup

1. Deck Selection: Each player selects one restaurant deck.
2. Customers:
   - Remove all Customer Cards from all decks and combine them into a shared customer deck.
   - Shuffle, then deal 1 face‑up customer to each player (start personal queues).
   - Reveal 2 face‑up customers as the central queue; place the rest face down as a draw pile.
3. Your Station:
   - Place your Ability Card in front of you.
   - Shuffle your deck, place it face down as your draw pile; draw 6 cards.
   - Reserve space for a discard pile, End Condition tracking, an in‑play area (ingredients/recipes/
     utensils/drinks), and a scoring pile for served customers.
4. First Player: choose randomly. Turns proceed clockwise.

## Limits

- Hand Limit: 6 cards (7 with Kitchenware).
- Play Limit (cards per turn): 3 cards (4 with Cookware).
- Customer Queue Limit: 2 customers (3 with Tableware).

## Turn Structure

On your turn:

1. Attract: Take 1 customer from the central queue and add it to the right of your queue. Then
   refill the central queue if possible.
2. Play: Put Ingredient, Recipe, Drink & Event Cards into play up to the play Limit.
3. Serve:
   - Allocate cooked serve value to customers in your queue. Each customer’s base value must be
     fully covered in a single turn to serve them. Discard the used cooked recipes and their
     ingredients; move those customers to your scoring pile.
   - If you play a Drink or meet a Drink’s requirement, move all customers from your queue to your
     scoring pile. Drinks stay in play and re‑trigger each time their requirement is met.
   - If you serve 2 recipes with the same utensil symbol, you may put that Utensil Card into play.
4. End of Turn:
   - If your queue is empty, attract 1 customer from the central queue.
   - If your queue is at its limit, pass your leftmost customer to the player on your left as their
     rightmost.

Outside your turn: You may discard up to 3 cards, then draw to your hand limit.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Ingredients come in three types:
- Primary — Required in every recipe.
- Secondary — Required in normal and hard recipes.
- Optional — At most 1 per recipe; increases that recipe’s serve value by 1.

### Recipe Cards

Recipes are cooked using prepared ingredients and provide serve value; they do not score by
themselves.
- Easy: Requires 1 Primary — serve value 1.
- Normal: Requires 1 Primary + 1 Secondary — serve value 2.
- Hard: Requires 1 Primary + 2 Secondary — serve value 4.

Cooking and Serving:
- Prepare Ingredients: Play ingredients to your in‑play area; they become prepared and unused.
- Cook: Place a recipe on top of prepared, unused ingredients that fulfill its requirements.
- Serve: During your Serve step, use cooked recipes’ serve values to cover customers’ base values;
  then discard the used cooked recipes and their ingredients.

### Drink Cards

Play when their requirement is met. When played, immediately move all customers from your queue to 
your scoring pile. The Drink remains in play and re‑triggers this effect each time its requirement 
is met.

### Event Cards

One‑time effects that can affect any queue (including the central queue):
- Complaint: Discard 1 customer from any queue.
- Promotion: Swap 2 customers between any two queues.
- Discount: Move 1 customer from your queue or the central queue to your scoring pile without
  covering its base value.

### Customer Cards

- Base Value (1–4): The serve value you must allocate in a single turn to serve that customer.
- Bonus Value: Scores if you meet its requirements at game end. Requirements include:
  - Globe: Your deck’s nationality matches the customer.
  - Utensil (X): You have at least X Utensil cards in tracking.
  - Gold medal (X): You have at least X End Condition cards in tracking.
  - Drink (X): You have at least X Drink Cards in play.

### Utensil Cards

Each deck has Kitchenware, Cookware, and Tableware.
- Putting Into Play: If in one turn you serve 2 recipes with the same utensil symbol, you may put
  the matching Utensil Card into play.
- Ongoing Effects while in play:
  - Kitchenware: Hand limit +1 (6 → 7).
  - Cookware: Play limit +1 (3 → 4).
  - Tableware: Queue limit +1 (2 → 3).

### Ability Card

Lists your deck’s unique ability, its End Condition, and how to track it. Use it to guide your
strategy. Special abilities are evaluated only from served recipes, and a card cannot participate in
more than one special ability occurrence.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the round in which a player puts 4 End Condition cards into tracking or the
customer deck is emptied. Finish the current round. Then calculate the total VP from your served 
customers (base plus bonus values). Highest total wins.

Tiebreaker: the player who most recently cooked a real‑life meal wins.
