## Objective

Win by scoring the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game.

## Setup

1. Each player chooses a restaurant deck.
2. Remove all customer cards from player decks and combine them into a central customer deck.
   Shuffle and draw customer cards equal to the number of players + 1 (minimum 4) and place them
   face up in the center as the central customer queue. Place the rest as a face down draw pile and
   keep discard pile on the other side of the queue.
3. Each player sets up their station:
    - Place your Ability Card in front of you.
    - Place your deck (draw pile) face down to your left and draw 7 cards for your starting hand.
    - Place your discard pile to your right.
    - Place your win condition cards to the right of your Ability Card.
    - Place ingredients & recipes above the Ability Card.
    - Place your personal customer queue above your ingredients & recipes.
4. Decide the first player randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.

## Turn Structure

1. Discard up to 2 cards from your hand, then draw back up to 7 cards (reshuffle discard pile if
   needed).
2. Choose **one** main action: **Prepare**, **Cook**, or **Serve**. To be able to **Serve**, you 
must have at least one customer card in your queue.
   - **Prepare:** - Place ingredients from your hand as **prepared** and **unused**.
   - **Cook:** - Combine **prepared** and **unused** ingredients with recipe cards to cook them.
   - **Serve:** - Score **cooked** recipes for VP based on your combined customer queue order limit.
3. Once per turn you may take a customer card from the central queue if you meet its
   requirements (max 3 customers can be in your queue unless stated otherwise).
4. At any point during your turn, you may play **Event** cards (**Complaint** or **Promotion**) to
   manipulate the customer queues.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

- **Primary:** Used in all recipes.
- **Secondary:** Used in **normal** and **hard** recipes.
- **Optional:** Can be used in a recipe for **+2 VP**.

### Recipe Cards

- **Easy:** 1 Primary ingredient (**1 VP**)
- **Normal:** 1 Primary + 1 Secondary (**2 VP**)
- **Hard:** 1 Primary + 2 Secondary (**3 VP**)

When **hard** recipes are cooked, all **easy** & **normal** recipes cooked that turn score **+1 VP
** (this effect stacks).

### Event Cards

- **Complaint:** Discard a customer card from any queue.
- **Promotion:** Swap a customer card between your queue and another.

### Customer Cards

- Attract customers from the central queue by meeting their requirements (max 3 in your queue
unless stated otherwise).
- Each customer card has an order number (number of recipes it can be served).
- When served, may grant a buff (bonus) or inflict a penalty on an opponent.
- If nationality matches your deck, gain **+1 VP** when served.
- Some have a **utensil symbol** that grants **+1 VP** for each served recipe with a matching 
utensil (does not stack).

### Ability Card

Shows your deck's special ability and win condition.

## Player Actions

### Prepare

Place any number of ingredient cards from your hand in front of you as **prepared** & **unused**
ingredients.

### Cook

Combine **prepared** & **unused** ingredients with recipe cards to cook them (place the recipe card
on top of its used ingredients).

### Serve

Score **cooked** recipes for VP, up to the total recipe limit of your customer queue. Apply customer
card effects and discard all served customer cards. You may place 1 win condition card per turn in
your win condition area.

### Attract Customers

Once per turn if you meet a customer card's requirements in the central queue, take it into your 
queue (max 3 unless stated otherwise).

### Complaint & Promotion

At any time in your turn play **Complaint** or **Promotion** event cards to discard or swap 
customer cards.

## Winning the Game

- The game ends at the end of the round in which a player reaches **40 VP** or meets their **Win
  Condition**.
- Each win condition card is worth **5 VP** (but all 4 = 30 VP).
- If there is a tie the most recent player to have cooked in real life wins.
