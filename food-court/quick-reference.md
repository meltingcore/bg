## Objective

Players aim to score the most Victory Points (VP) by cooking and serving recipes, playing drink
and event cards, triggering customer and special ability effects.

## Setup

1. **Deck Selection:** Each player selects a restaurant deck.
2. **Central Customer Queue Creation:**
    - All players remove the customer cards from their decks and combine these into a shared
      customer deck.
    - Shuffle the deck and draw customer cards equal to the number of players plus 1 to form the
      **central customer queue**.
    - Place the remaining customer deck face down as draw pile, with space for a face-down discard
      pile on the opposite side of the queue.
3. **Player Station Setup:**
    - Place the **Ability Card** in front of the player.
    - Place the player deck face down on the left side as draw pile and draw 7 cards for a starting
      hand.
    - Reserve space to the right of the Ability Card for the **discard pile** and **End Condition
      Cards**.
    - Above the Ability Card, players will place their **prepared ingredients and cooked recipes**.
    - Above that, players will maintain their **personal customer queue**.
4. Choose **First Player:** randomly and start the game.

## Turn Structure

Game is played in rounds where 1 round consists of all players taking their turns clockwise.  
Each player turn consists of the following:

1. **Main Action:** Choose 1 of the following actions:
    * **Cook:** 
       1. Put up to 3 ingredient cards as prepared and unused.
       2. Cook up to 2 easy or 1 non-easy (normal or hard) recipe using their cards and the prepared
       ingredients to cover their requirements.
    * **Serve:** Serve cooked recipes to customers in the player queue and resolve any customer and
       special ability effects to score points. Set aside 1 end condition card for tracking if
       applicable.
2. **Attract Customers:** At the end of a turn if requirements are met, attract 1 customer from the
   central queue to the player queue.
3. **Additional Actions:** Players may perform any of the following actions at any time:
    - Play event cards.
    - Play drink cards.

Outside their turn players discard up to 3 cards and draw up to the hand limit (7 or 8 depending
whether the hand increase customer effect is active).

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Ingredient cards represent the various components needed to cook recipes. They come in three
categories:

- **Primary Ingredients** – Required in every recipe.
- **Secondary Ingredients** – Required in normal and hard recipes.
- **Optional Ingredients** – Can be added to any recipe to grant +1 VP when served.

### Recipe Cards

Recipe cards represent dishes that players can cook and serve for points. They vary in complexity
and scoring potential:

- **Easy:** Requires 1 Primary Ingredient — worth 1 VP.
- **Normal:** Requires 1 Primary + 1 Secondary Ingredient — worth 2 VP.
- **Hard:** Requires 1 Primary + 2 Secondary Ingredients — worth 4 VP.

### Drink Cards

Drink cards gives VP but unlike recipes, drinks require no ingredients and can be played at any 
time as long as their condition is met and there is at least once customer in the player's queue.

### Event Cards

Event cards provide one-time strategic effects that can impact any player's queue and can be played
at any time. They are:

- **Complaint:** Discards a customer from any queue.
- **Promotion:** Swaps 2 customers from any two queues.
- **Discount:** Allows a player to attract a customer from the central queue, ignoring its
  requirements and the limit of attracting only 1 customer per turn.

### Customer Cards

Customer must be attracted so that players can serve them and score points. They are drawn from a 
shared central queue and added to individual player queues when their requirements are met. Each 
customer increases the player’s serving capacity and grant various effects.

- Players may attract 1 customer per turn (unless using a Discount event card).
- Players may have a maximum of 3 customers in their personal queue.
- Customer effects that are not ongoing only activate if at least one recipe is served to them.
- Customer effects that are ongoing apply immediately when the card is put in play and are active
  immediately and while the customer remains in the queue.
- Customer effects do not stack if duplicated.

### Ability Card

Each deck includes an ability card that outlines the deck’s unique ability, its end condition and 
how to track it.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the round in which a player completes their **end condition**. 
All players must finish their turns so a round could end.

The winner is determined by the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game.
Each end condition card in tracking counts as 2VP towards the final score of player.

**Tiebreaker:** The player who most recently cooked a real-life meal wins.
