## BMG Feedback

### Playtest 1 [2025-02-20]

Looking for general feedback on the game.  
Role cards were not used in this playtest.  
4 rounds played with 4 players (using Italy, France, China & India decks).  

Feedback:

- loved the theme
- defensive action cards should stay ready to be used (for 1 round only maybe)
- put base reward value on the recipe cards (x2)
- ingredients vs recipe cards win condition tracking may not be balanced
- rate the game: 7/8 out of 10
- defensive/offensive cards support player interaction but create a tension between playing solo
and getting aggro from opponents
- like that playing cards in advance frees up your hand, but it also keeps a lot of things to track
(but not bad with placemats) 
- mechanics-wise seems ok so possibly play testing needed mainly for deck balance
