## BMG Feedback

### Playtest 1 [2025-02-20]

Looking for general feedback on the game.  
Role cards were not used in this playtest.  
4 rounds played with 4 players (using Italy, France, China & India decks).  

Feedback:

- loved the theme
- defensive action cards should stay ready to be used (for 1 round only maybe)
- put base reward value on the recipe cards (x2)
- ingredients vs recipe cards win condition tracking may not be balanced
- rate the game: 7/8 out of 10
- defensive/offensive cards support player interaction but create a tension between playing solo
and getting aggro from opponents
- like that playing cards in advance frees up your hand, but it also keeps a lot of things to track
(but not bad with placemats) 
- mechanics-wise seems ok so possibly play testing needed mainly for deck balance

### Playtest 2 [2025-02-27]

Looking for general feedback on the game + player interaction  
Role cards were not used in this playtest.  
4 rounds played with 4 players (using Italy, France, China & India decks). 

- discard/redraw at the beginning of the turn + being in parallel
- turns are way too long (reduce amount of actions or amount of cards)
- decisions are based on what you draw (fine for light game) but for complex ones think of more choices
- offensive actions not suitable for cooking game
- shared ingredient pool
- upside/down text at cards is bad
- defensive not right word for action cards
- needs more interaction but maybe not from nasty cards
- if you didn't start attacking i would have played defensively 
- beginning more defensive so offensive actions could happen more towards end game

### Playtest 3 [2025-03-06]

Looking for:
- general feedback on the game
- player interaction (events vs actions, mechanics, max 1 per column yes or no, etc.)
- speed of turn structure now that all besides scoring happens in parallel.

- parallel turns are good BUT structure is needed;
- utensils are kinda pointless;
- some events cards are much better than others;
- choice when preparing ingredients instead of just dumping them;
- like the theme and the act of cooking;
---
- long teaching
- italian deck is too easy to play
- possibly play-mats are needed cause its complex
- downtime during scoring
---
- win conditions why only 1 per turn
- no interesting decisions
- utensils incentivize to never score
- strong theme
