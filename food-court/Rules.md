## Overview

You are at the mall, you did your shopping, and now you are starving so you go to the food court.
But what do you want to eat? Which restaurant will you choose? They all look so good!...

Welcome to the ultimate culinary competition!
Each player plays as a restaurant in the mall's food court that specializes in a specific cuisine.
The restaurant is represented as a deck with unique ingredients, recipes, and abilities.  
The restaurants compete by cooking recipes, utilizing their special abilities, and striving to
achieve their win conditions.

## Objective

Get the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game.

## Setup

Each player chooses a deck to play with.

Then all players take out all their customer cards from their decks to be mixed into a common
customer deck. When the customer deck is shuffled, draw customer cards equal to the number of
players + 1 (but no less than 4) and place them face up in the center of the table to form the
central customer queue. The deck is then placed face down next to the central queue as a draw pile
with a face down discard pile on the other side of the queue.

Then each player sets up their station as follows:

![image](images/guide_setup.png)

1. Place your deck's ability card in front of you.
2. Place your deck on your left face down, shuffle it and draw 7 cards for your starting hand.
3. On you right, you will place your discarded cards in a pile face down.
4. On the right of the ability card, you will place your win condition cards.
5. Above the ability card you will place your ingredients & recipes.
6. Above the ingredients & recipes you will place the customer cards that form your queue.

Decide the first player randomly and start the game (play proceeds clockwise).

## Turn Structure

Players take turns in order.

During their turn, players always start by discarding up to 2 cards from their hand & drawing cards
until they have 7 cards in hand (unless stated otherwise).
When the draw pile depletes reshuffle the discard pile back into it.

Then they can choose to do 1 of 3 actions: **Prepare**, **Cook** or **Serve**.

When **preparing** players put ingredient cards in front of them as **prepared** but **unused**.  
When **cooking** players combine **prepared** & **unused** ingredients and recipe cards on top of
them to cook them.  
When **serving** players score from:
  - their **cooked** recipes by serving them to the customers in their queue (so no more than the
  sum of the order numbers of all customer cards in their queue).
  - any special ability effects if eligible.
  - customer effects
  - customer nationality bonuses (if the customer is from the player's cuisine)

Once per turn the players can take one of the customer cards from the center if they
meet its requirements and place it in their customer cards area until they have 3 (unless stated
otherwise). For more information on the customer cards mechanic refer to the 
[Customer Cards](#customer-cards) section.

At any point during their turn, player can also play event cards to manipulate the customer queues.
More information on the event cards mechanic can be found in the [Event Cards](#event-cards)
section.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Can be:

- **Primary** - Used in all recipes.
- **Secondary** - Used in **normal** and **hard** recipes.
- **Optional** - Can be used in a recipe to grant **+2 VP**.

![image](images/guide_ingredient.png)

Ingredient cards have the following structure:

- **Ingredient Icon** - Represents the type of the ingredient so you can recognize it in
  recipe requirements. Darker border means it is a **primary** ingredient.
- **Ingredient Picture** - A picture of the ingredient.
- **Ingredient Description** - Tells you which recipes the ingredient can be used in.
- **Ingredient Type** - The type of the ingredient (primary, secondary, optional).
- **Ingredient Name** - The name of the ingredient.
- **Special Symbol** - In some decks, the ingredient has a special symbol that can be used as visual
  aid for certain deck mechanics. In the above example it tells you that this is a Tagliatelle
  so you know if the recipe cooked with it scores extra points for using exact pasta ingredient.
- **Win Condition Symbol** - If present it indicates this card can be used to track the win
  condition for the deck

### Recipe Cards

Can be:

- **Easy** - Require 1 **primary** ingredient.
- **Normal** - Require 1 **primary** and 1 **secondary** ingredient.
- **Hard** - Require 1 **primary** and 2 **secondary** ingredients.

They grant **1 VP** for each ingredient used so **1 VP** for **easy**, **2 VP** for
**normal** and **3 VP** for **hard** recipes.

![image](images/guide_recipe.png)

Recipe cards have the following structure:

- **Utensil Symbol** - Depicts the utensil type that can be used to score extra VP.
- **Recipe Pictures** - Pictures of the dish in monochrome (cooking) and color (ready to score).
- **Recipe Score** - Base score value of the recipe.
- **Recipe Type** - The difficulty of the recipe (easy, normal, hard).
- **Recipe Name** - The name of the dish.
- **Ingredient Requirements** - The ingredients needed to cook the recipe.
- **Special Symbol** - In some decks, the recipe has a special symbol that is used for their special
  ability. In the above example it tells you that this recipe is a Main course recipe.
- **Scoring Symbols** - Used to calculate the total score of the recipe when serving.
- **Win Condition Symbol** - If present it indicates this card can be used to track the win
  condition.

**Hard** recipes when cooked make all **easy** & **normal** cooked recipes to score extra **1 VP**.
For example if you cook 1 **hard** recipe along with 2 **easy** recipes that turn, you score extra
**2 VP** for the **easy** recipes totalling to 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **7 VP**. This effect stacks so if
you cook 2 **hard** recipes and 2 **easy** recipe you score 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **12 VP**.

### Event Cards

Each deck includes 2 **Complaint** cards & 3 **Promotion** cards.

- **Complaint** - Use it to discard a customer card from the queue of any player or from the
  central customer queue.
- **Promotion** - Use it to swap a customer card from your queue with a customer card from the
  queue of any player or from the central customer queue.

### Customer Cards

Customers stand in the middle of the food court forming a central queue. The central queue is
made of a number of customer cards equal to the number of players + 1 (but no less than 4).

Each player competes to attract customers to their restaurant in order to serve them and thus score
victory points (VP). To do so they must check if they cover the requirements of the customer card
and if they do, they can take the customer card and place it in their own customer queue.

A player cannot have more than 3 customer cards in their queue (unless stated otherwise).

When at least one customer is attracted (one customer card is placed in the player's queue) a player
can choose to perform the **Serve** action to score from their cooked recipes.
Each customer card has an order number that depicts how many recipes can be served to them.
More customer cards results in raising that limit (i.e. if you have 3 customers in your queue with
1, 2 and 2 recipe orders respectively, the total amount of recipes you can serve (score from) is 5).

After serving is complete all customer cards in the player's queue are discarded to the common 
customer deck's discard pile.

![image](images/guide_customer.png)

- **Ingredient Card Requirements** - The **prepared** and **unused** ingredient cards needed to 
attract the customer to the player's queue.
- **Recipe Card Requirements** - The **cooked** recipe cards needed to attract the customer to the
player's queue.
- **Order Number** - The number of recipes that can be served to the customer. The sum of this
number across all customer cards in the player's queue is the total number of recipes that can be
served (scored from) during the **Serve** action.
- **Nationality** - Players gain extra **+1 VP** if the customer is from their cuisine's nationality
& are served at least one recipe.
- **Effect Icon & Description** - The effect granted by the customer card. The effect can be either
a buff to the player or a debuff to an opponent. Effects that are granted by the customer cards 
"when serving" are granted if the player serves at least one recipe to them. Other effects are 
always granted as long as the customer card is in the player's queue.

Each player deck has the following Customer Cards:

| Buff / Debuff                | Requirements                        | Order Number         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Kitchenware (Utensil)        | 2 Ingredients                       | 1                    |
| Cookware    (Utensil)        | 2 Recipes / 1 Ingredient & 1 Recipe | 1 / 2                |
| Tableware   (Utensil)        | 2 Recipes / 1 Ingredient & 1 Recipe | 1 / 2                |
| Player Gains 2 VP            | 2 Ingredients & 1 Recipe            | 1                    |
| Opponent Loses 2 VP          | 2 Ingredients & 2 Recipes           | 1                    |
| Hand Limit Increased by 1    | 2 Ingredients & 1 Recipe            | 2                    |
| Customer Queue Limit is 4    | 2 Ingredients & 2 Recipes           | 2                    |
| Discard 1 Win Condition Card | 3 Recipes                           | 1                    |

The customer card effects are either:

- One time only during serving (i.e. Gain 2 VP)
- Ongoing (valid) each turn until the card is discarded (i.e. Increased Hand or Queue Limit)
- Utensils - **Kitchenware** (Cutting board and a knife), **Cookware** (Cooking pot) or
**Tableware** (Plate and cutlery) that grant **+1 VP** for each cooked and served recipe that has a
symbol matching the utensil. Keep in mind this effect does not stack so you cannot score 3 VP from
a single recipe if you have 3 customer cards with the same utensil symbol in your queue. You can 
however score 3 VP from 3 recipes with different utensil symbols if you have the 3 customer cards 
with the different utensils in your queue.

### Ability Card

Explains your deck's special ability and win condition.

## Player Actions

### Main Actions

Players can choose to do one of the 3 main actions during their turn as follows:

#### Prepare

You put as much ingredient cards as you want from your hand in front of you. They are now counted
as **prepared** but **unused** ingredients. You can use them later to cook recipes.

#### Cook

You put in play (cook) as much recipe cards as you want as follows:

- choose from the **prepared & unused** ingredient cards to meet the recipe requirements and put 
them in a column with an overlap so you can see their symbols on the top.
- put the recipe card on top of the ingredients' column.

![image](images/guide_cooking.png)

#### Serve

You score from as much cooked recipes as is the sum of your customer queue's order limits.

Scoring happens as follows:

- Score VP for:
    - cooked recipes
    - any special ability effects if eligible
    - customer effects and nationality bonuses
- If you have a card from a cooked recipe that is used to track your win condition, place it in
  your win condition tracking area.

You can only put 1 win condition card per turn!

At any point during the above actions you can also do the following:

### Additional Actions

Player can choose to do any of the following during their turn:

### Attract Customers

Choose a customer card from the central queue and check if you meet its requirements.
If you do, take the customer card and place it in your customer queue.
Use the customer card's limit during the **Serve** action and its effect accordingly.

### Complaint & Promotion

Play **Complaint** & **Promotion** cards to respectively discard or swap customers with opponents.

For detailed information on the effects of the event cards refer to the
[Event Cards](#event-cards) section.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the end of the round in which a player reaches 40 VP or meets its Win Condition.
(end of the round means all player have taken their turns).
To determine the winner, calculate the VP of all players (each win condition card is worth 5 VP,
but if all 4 are present the total bonus is 30 instead of 20 VP).
If there is still a tie, the one who most recently cooked in real life wins.

## Examples

![image](images/guide_table.png)

- 4 Player game but visible is only 1 player station and the central customer queue.
- From the player station is visible that:
  - the player is playing with the **Piazza Romana** deck.
  - the player has 2 win condition cards in their tracking area (2 more to go).
  - the player has 3 prepared and unused ingredients - 1 primary, 1 secondary and 1 optional.
  - the player has 2 cooked recipes - 1 easy and 1 normal.
  - the player has 2 customer cards in their queue with a total order limit of 2 recipes
  - both customer cards grant benefits upon serving and 1 is the same nationality as the player.

Technically the player can take 1 more customer card from the central queue to fill theirs, but 
they will have to cook another recipe to benefit from the effects of all 3.
If the player decides to serve this turn they will get total of 6 VP:
  - 3 VP from the normal recipe (base 2 + 1 from the Italian customer card effect)
  - 1 VP from the easy recipe
  - 2 VP from the French customer card effect
