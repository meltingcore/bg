# Notes

## IDEAS:

### DECKS:

- In the Sweden deck you can have 6-7 recipes all for Surströmming (the rotten fish).
  A special ability could be that can cook such recipe but if you do you cannot cook any other
  recipe.
  However, it gives you as much VP as cards you decide to discard from your hand (up to 3). End
  condition could be to cook Surströmming 4 times with a 3 card discard each time.
- In the Thai deck you can mark each recipe with a flavour type (sour, sweet, salty, bitter, spicy).
  You can also have the ingredients marked with the same flavour types. The special ability could be
  that if you match the flavour types of the recipe and the ingredients you get +1 VP. End condition
  could be to make 4 recipes with 4 different flavour types.
- The Greek deck can have a special ability that when you cook a recipe with olive oil ingredient
  you can draw 1 card to be used on top of the maximum hand limit next turn. For normal and hard
  recipes you will also get 1 VP. End condition could be to cook 4 seafood recipes.
- German deck based on different kind of wursts. Special ability and end condition could be about
  combining the wursts with beer?!
- English deck?

### MECHANICS & GAMEPLAY

Redesign the mechanics for ease of play, streamlining the turn structure and dramatically ease the
calculations to just the end of the game:

- Customer cards have 1, 2, 3 & 4 as base value on them and this indicates what is needed to be
  served to attract a customer (i.e. 1 customer with value 2 can be attracted by 2 easy recipes
  with values 1 or 1 normal recipe with value 2). This customer card stays with the player until the
  end of the game for scoring. Therefore, recipe cards should now have just base value + extra 1
  bonus from special ability as value points. Utensil symbol remains but does not give points and
  instead is used for summoning utensil cards (see below).
- Customer cards will be solely used for scoring with the total score of a card being its base value
  (1,2, 3 or 4) + its extra value (if the customer requirement is achieved). At the end of the game 
  each player calculates the total amount of points from its attracted customers to determine the 
  winner.
- During game setup customer cards are dealt from a shuffled customer deck so that there is one in
  front of each player and 2 are placed face up in the center as central queue. During their turn a 
  player takes one from the central queue (which is then filled) and puts it on the right of its 
  current one (if present) forming a queue from left to right. If they can serve them recipes 
  (covering their base value) they attract the customers in a pile next to them and if left with 
  zero customers (no queue) they immediately draw 1 more (there must be at least 1 customer in front
  of them). At the end of the turn if still at the customer limit they move the one at the start of
  the queue to the end of the queue of the player on the left. If the customer deck is depleted the
  round must be finished (everyone that still haven't should complete their turn) and then the game
  ends.
- Customers requirements which give extra points are various types depicted by icons as follows:
    - globe - the player must be from the same nationality as the customer.
    - utensil - the player must have the depicted utensil card in play.
    - gold medal - the player must have X end condition cards in tracking (where X is the number of 
    medals depicted).
    - drink - the player must have X drink cards in play (where X is the number of bottles 
    depicted).
- Customer requirements can be single one or a combination of the above which could be strict (AND)
  or flexible (OR).
- Each deck should have the following customer distribution:
    - 1 customer with base value 4 (hard to attract but gives 4 points)
    - 3 customers with base value 3 (medium hard to attract but gives 3 points)
    - 3 customers with base value 2 (medium easy to attract but gives 2 points)
    - 2 customers with base value 1 (easy to attract but gives 1 point)
- End condition remains but the game will also end if the combined customer deck is emptied.
- Drinks are like recipes but with prerequisites instead of ingredient requirements. When they are
  put in play they attract all customers directly from the player's queue (and continue to do so 
  each time their requirement is met as they stay in play for scoring purposes).
- Each deck has 3 utensil cards listed below. Each utensil card can be put in play if 2 recipes with
  its symbol are served at the same round. Utensils cards like drink card stay in play until the end
  for scoring purposes. The utensils cards also have the following ongoing effects while in play:
    - Kitchenware: Hand limit is increased by 1 (default is 6 so 7).
    - Cookware: Play card limit per turn is increased by 1 (default is 3 so 4).
    - Tableware: Customer queue limit is increased by 1 (default is 2 so 3).
- Event cards are reduced to 1/1/1 (1 Complaint, 1 Promotion, 1 Discount) and their effects are
  adjusted as follows:
    - Complaint: Discards a customer from any player's queue or the central .
    - Promotion: Swaps 2 customers from any two players' queues.
    - Discount: Allows a player to attract a customer from its queue without serving.
