# Notes

## IDEAS:

### DECKS:

- In the Sweden deck you can have 6-7 recipes all for Surströmming (the rotten fish).
  A special ability could be that can cook such recipe but if you do you cannot cook any other
  recipe.
  However, it gives you as much VP as cards you decide to discard from your hand (up to 3). End
  condition could be to cook Surströmming 4 times with a 3 card discard each time.
- In the Thai deck you can mark each recipe with a flavour type (sour, sweet, salty, bitter, spicy).
  You can also have the ingredients marked with the same flavour types. The special ability could be
  that if you match the flavour types of the recipe and the ingredients you get +1 VP. End condition
  could be to make 4 recipes with 4 different flavour types.
- The Greek deck can have a special ability that when you cook a recipe with olive oil ingredient
  you can draw 1 card to be used on top of the maximum hand limit next turn. For normal and hard
  recipes you will also get 1 VP. End condition could be to cook 4 seafood recipes.
- German deck based on different kind of wursts. Special ability and end condition could be about
  combining the wursts with beer?!
- English deck?

### MECHANICS & GAMEPLAY

Redesign the mechanics for ease of play, streamlining the turn structure and dramatically ease the
calculations to just the end of the game:

- Both Recipes and Customer cards have 1, 2 or 3 on them and this indicates what is needed to be
  covered to attract a customer (i.e. 1 customer with value 2 can be attracted by 2 easy recipes
  with values 1 or 1 normal recipe with value 2). This customer card stays with the player until the
  end of the game for scoring. Therefore, recipe cards should now have just base value + extra 1 for
  special ability + utensil symbol for summoning utensil cards (see below)
- Customer card will be solely used for scoring with the score of a card being its base value (1,2
  or 3) + value from its effect (if any). At the end of the game each player calculates the total
  amount of points to determine the winner.
- Customer cards should be dealt from a deck so that there is one in front of each player.
- Customers effects which give extra points are various types:
    - +1 if the customer card is from the same nationality as the player's deck.
    - +1 if the customer card has utensil symbol that the player has in play and is enabled.
    - +X points as flat bonus where X is 1,2 or 3.
    - +X points if the player has at least X end condition cards in play.
    - +X points if the player has at least X drink cards played.
    - Some don't have effects and are just base value.
- End condition remains but the game will also end if the combined customer deck is emptied.
- End condition cards should award 1, 2, 3 & 4 at the end of the game based on how many you have in
  play (so complete end condition is extra 10 points).
- Drinks are like recipes but with prerequisites instead of ingredient requirements. They are worth
  2 points when attracting customers.
- Utensils cards are back to the decks. Each utensil card can be put permanently if 2 or 3 recipes with
  its symbol are served at the same round. Then all customers with that utensil symbol give +1 when
  scoring. The utensils cards should have also the following effects:
    - Kitchenware: Hand limit is increased by 1.
    - Cookware: Can play 1 more card per turn.
    - Tableware: Can attract 1 extra customer per turn.
- Event cards are reduced to 1/1/1 and add 4th "malfunction" one is added to disable a utensil card 
  (that can be enabled if its condition is done again)
- What are the different strategies to win?
    - Go for end condition cards fast to end the game early and hope to have the most points.
    - Go for utensil cards and gather customers with utensil symbols
    - Go for drink cards and gather customers with drink symbols
    - Go for customers from 
    there any agency or you just play what you draw and hope for the best?! Maybe the customer scoring
    depends on which end condition you chose to persue and the rest do not amount? i.e. customers give
    extra points for one of drinks, for utensils and for end condition completion (i.e. +1 if at least
    2 end condition cards are in play). Or maybe you just have different end conditions (drinks,
    utensils, end condition cards) and all give you bonus?
