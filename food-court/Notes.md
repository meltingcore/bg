# Notes

## IDEAS:

### DECKS:

- In the Sweden deck you can have 6-7 recipes all for Surströmming (the rotten fish).
A special ability could be that can cook such recipe but if you do you cannot cook any other recipe.
However, it gives you as much VP as cards you decide to discard from your hand (up to 3). End
condition could be to cook Surströmming 4 times with a 3 card discard each time.
- In the Thai deck you can mark each recipe with a flavour type (sour, sweet, salty, bitter, spicy).
You can also have the ingredients marked with the same flavour types. The special ability could be
that if you match the flavour types of the recipe and the ingredients you get +1 VP. End condition
could be to make 4 recipes with 4 different flavour types.
- The Greek deck can have a special ability that when you cook a recipe with olive oil ingredient
you can draw 1 card to be used on top of the maximum hand limit next turn. For normal and hard
recipes you will also get 1 VP. End condition could be to cook 4 seafood recipes.
- German deck based on different kind of wursts. Special ability and end condition could be about
combining the wursts with beer?!
- English deck?

### MECHANICS & GAMEPLAY

Redesign the mechanics for ease of play, streamlining the turn structure and dramatically ease the calculations to just the end of the game:
- Both Recipes and Customer cards have 1, 2 or 3 on them and this indicates what is needed to be covered to attract a customer (i.e. 1 customer with value 2 can be attracted by 2 easy recipes with values 1 or 1 normal recipe with value 2). This customer card stays with the player until the end of the game for scoring. Therefore recipe cards should now have just base value + extra 1 for special ability + utensil symbol for summoning utensil cards (see below)
- Customer card will be solely used for scoring with the score of a card being its base value (1,2 or 3) + value from its effect (if any). At the end of the game each player calculates the total amount of points to determine the winner. Each end condition card counts as 2 points? Customers from the same nationality as the player's deck score extra 1 point. Those with utensil symbol also if the utensil symbol is in play (see below). Some just give extra points. Some dont have effects and are just base value. Any other effects?
- End condition remains but the game will also end if the combined customer deck is emptied or if all utensils are in play and enabled or if all drinks are in play (in which end condition cards should be renamed)? Or just leave end condition cards for end and the rest is just for bonuses?
- Drinks are like hard recipes without ingredients that can be played at any time (so they do not amount to the limit of 3 per turn). If the condition is met just attract the amount of customers possible. Or maybe you just gather all 3 drinks to end the game?
- Should add the utensils cards back to the decks. Each utensil card can be put permanently if 3? recipes with its symbol are served at the same round. Then all customers with that utensil symbol give +1 when scoring. There should also be a 4th utensil cuisine specific card that can increase the amount of cards to be played per turn by 1. It can be played for free if no other utensils are in play and should be discarded if another utensil is put into play.
- Should reduce the event cards to 1/1/1 and add 4th "malfunction" one to disable a utensil card (that can be enabled if its condition is done again)
- Should reduce the ingredients and recipes to ease on the deck size so that customer deck is not depleted super fast before a player has a chance to finish his own deck - aim is to maintain a standard 54 deck of cards.
- What are the different strategies to win - Go for end condition cards? Go for utensil cards? Is there any agency or you just play what you draw and hope for the best?! Maybe the customer scoring depends on which end condition you chose to persue and the rest do not amount? i.e. customers give extra points for one of drinks, for utensils and for end condition completion (i.e. +1 if at least 2 end condition cards are in play). Or maybe you just have different end conditions (drinks, utensils, end condition cards) and all give you bonus?
