## Description

In this competitive cooking card game, players choose a cuisine deck and race to create delicious
recipes while using unique abilities and strategies.
Each deck features primary, secondary, and optional ingredients, recipes of varying difficulty,
action cards to sabotage opponents, and utensils for bonus points.
Players take turns to Draw Cards, Prepare Ingredients, Cook Recipes and Score Victory Points.
Achieve victory by either completing your deck's unique win condition or by scoring VP.

Collaborate, compete, and cook your way to culinary glory!

## Mission Statement

The idea behind and the main goal of this project is to create a card game that:

1. Has easy-to-understand rules and mechanics - It should be like 7 Wonders or Small World. You have
to be able to explain the game in 5-10 minutes. If you have to watch YouTube tutorials to grasp
the game or the rule book is comparable to a novel, then it should have been a video game where the
engine can offload you of some of the mechanics. :)
2. Should be easy to set up - You don't have to have a dedicated room in your house so that
when you set up the game for 2 hours you can just lock the room for the next session because you 
don't want to pack the game back in the box for 1 hour and then rinse and repeat next time. 1 game
session should also not be more than an hour... People do not have that much spare time. :)
3. Has a good balance between luck and strategy - It should be fun to play even if you are not
winning. Luck is unavoidable in any kind of game that involves drawing cards or throwing dice, but
it should not be the only factor that determines the winner. You should be able to make at least
some choices when playing the game instead of just dumping what you draw.
4. Should be easy to catch up - Everyone should play until the end and if you are behind, you should
have a chance to catch up. Nobody likes to play a game where you get killed but the game won't end
for another 40 min. Nobody wants to play a game where you are 30 points behind from the 3rd round
on, and it's clear who is going to win, but you have to play for another 40 min to see it happen.
5. Should have some kind of asymmetry - It should be fun to play with different decks. There is no
point of each player doing the same thing. However, we are aiming at relatively light asymmetry. It
should be like Blood Rage or Scythe, not like Vast (check the YouTube part above :)).
6. Should be fun to play - After all this should be simple card game that is fun to play. We are not
going to reinvent the wheel here or disrupt the board game industry. But next time you wander what
to order for a takeout, you can play this game to decide. :)

## Online Simulation

You can find the exported `png` deck templates [here](files/templates).
Play testing is available on [Screentop.gg](https://screentop.gg/@grumpper/meal-mayhem).

## Print And Play

You can download the print-ready PDFs as folows:

- [Decks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RjN7gm9uUmFUjK3Yv4_XwoySk4Y0jHjB?usp=sharing)
- [Roles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtato6tITbTrM0xFkkSaoeRSS999X8Ku/view?usp=sharing)
- [Actions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0TfjAVLHZW4D9PotTRZZduPXj8LMDFb/view?usp=sharing)
- [Utensils](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEOwRXla9UpwlXIWsCkZbUjKwD3YBcrl/view?usp=sharing)

Each pdf contains the full 54 cards. But if you need it you can also print the action cards or
the utensils cards separately from the links above.

The format of the cards should fit standard European bridge size (57x87 mm / 2.25x3.43 inch).

## Disclaimers

- The design is currently for play testing purposes only (so cards are not just text on white).
It was made using [Photopeia](https://www.photopea.com/) using assets from
[FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/). I was way ahead with the card designs when I saw that I have
to mention the artists when I am using their work. So whoever recognizes their work in the cards,
please let me know so that I can give proper credit.
- The game is in its play testing phase so the "lore" of the game is not final. Once I stabilize
the mechanics and the balance of the game, I will work on the theme and the art of the game.
Recipes will be correctly classified, etc. 
- About authenticity and accuracy of the meals: It's still just a bunch of recipes for a game.
It's not going to be exhaustive, precise, authentic, encyclopedic representation of a cuisine... 
That is not the objective... I don't think such thing is even possible since even in various 
regions of the same country 1 recipe is done in different ways. Go ask 10 Italians how to do proper
Bolognese and you will get 10 different answers. So yeah - thematically I will stick to what
random 3 famous cooking sites compiled + the common knowledge from pop culture. Maybe there is
super signature and important dessert from Italy but in the game the mechanic of the Italian deck
revolves around pasta so with a limit of roughly 14 recipes per deck as of now I cannot properly 
represent the intricacies of the Italian cuisine in full... So I will stick to pasta recipes at the
expense of some Italians potentially being mad at me for having a card game not properly
representing their cuisine which the said game never claims to aim to do.
- If you have any feedback, please let me know as I am still developing this. :)
- Have fun!
