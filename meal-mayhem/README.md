## Tabletop Simulator

I am still trying to grasp the basics of TTS and how to make it work with my game.
So far I have only managed to compile the decks with TTS's deck builder. You can find the
the exported `png` deck templates [here](files/tts).

## Print And Play

You can download the print-ready PDFs as folows:

- [Decks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RjN7gm9uUmFUjK3Yv4_XwoySk4Y0jHjB?usp=sharing)
- [Roles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtato6tITbTrM0xFkkSaoeRSS999X8Ku/view?usp=sharing)
- [Actions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0TfjAVLHZW4D9PotTRZZduPXj8LMDFb/view?usp=sharing)
- [Utensils](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEOwRXla9UpwlXIWsCkZbUjKwD3YBcrl/view?usp=sharing)

Each pdf contains the full 54 cards. But if you need it you can also print the action cards or
the utensils cards separately from the links above.

The format of the cards should fit standard European bridge size (57x87 mm / 2.25x3.43 inch).
I used the below for my play testing without issues:
