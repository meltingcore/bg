## Overview

Welcome to the ultimate culinary competition! Each player selects a cuisine deck with unique
ingredients, recipes, and abilities. The goal is to outscore your opponents by cooking recipes,
utilizing your deck's special abilities, and achieving your win condition.

## Objective

Be the first to achieve your deck's win condition, OR score 40 Victory Points (VP) to win.

## Setup

1. Select a cuisine deck and place its country card in front of you.
2. Place your deck on your left face down, shuffle it and draw 8 cards for your starting hand.
3. On your right, you will place your discarded cards in a pile face down.
4. On the left of the country card, you will place your win condition cards.
5. On the right of the country card, you will place your utensils cards.
6. Decide the first player randomly and start the game.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of 4 phases. Each phase consists of multiple steps and for each step it is
explicitly mentioned if it is done in **parallel** or in player **order**.

### Shop Phase

1. [**parallel**] Discard up to 3 cards from your hand.
2. [**parallel**] Draw cards from your deck until you have 8 cards in your hand.
3. [**ordered**] Play your role card (if role cards are in play).

### Prepare Phase

1. [**parallel**] Play any ingredient or utensil cards from your hand to your preparation area.
2. [**ordered**] Play any suitable action cards and then discard them.

### Cook Phase

1. [**ordered**] Play any recipes from your hand as long as you meet their ingredient requirements.
You can cook multiple recipes if you have enough ingredients prepared.
2. [**ordered**] Play any suitable action cards and then discard them.

### Score Phase

1. [**ordered**] Score VP for recipes cooked + any special ability effects if eligible and any
utensil cards that match a cooked recipe.
2. [**ordered**] If you have a card(s) from a cooked recipe that are used to track your win
condition, place one of them (of your choosing) in your win condition tracking area.
3. [**parallel**] Discard any cooked recipes along with the ingredient used for them in your
discard pile.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Can be:

- **Primary** - Used in all recipes.
- **Secondary** - Used in **normal** and **hard** recipes.
- **Optional** - Can be used in a recipe to grant **+1 VP**. Limit is 1 **optional** ingredient
per recipe.

### Recipe Cards

Can be:

- **Easy** - Require 1 **primary** ingredient and grant **+1 VP**.
- **Normal** - Require 1 **primary** and 1 **secondary** ingredient and grant **+2 VP**.
- **Hard** - Require 1 **primary** and 2 **secondary** ingredients and grant **+3 VP**.

### Action Cards

Used to disrupt opponents. Each deck has the same 10 action cards as follows:

- **Block An Opponent Action** (x3) - Prevent an opponent from playing an action card. This card
can be used cumulatively (so your opponent can block your block, you theirs, etc.).
- **Discard up to 2 Prepared Ingredients** - Choose which ingredients the opponent should
discard.
- **Discard 1 Cooked Recipe** - Choose 1 cooked recipe the opponent should discard.
- **Discard 1 Win Condition Card** - Choose 1 win condition card the opponent should discard.
- **Discard 1 Utensil Card** - Choose 1 utensil card the opponent should discard.
- **Draw 2 Cards** - You can draw 3 more cards from the deck, disregarding the 8 cards hand limit
this turn (you still have to discard down to 8 cards at the end of the turn after scoring).
- **Universal Ingredients** - Place during the **prepare** phase as ingredient card. During the
**cook** phase you can cook any kind of recipe with only this card as all ingredient requirements
for it.
- **Cook Twice** - Place during the **cook** phase along with a recipe. During the **score** phase
count that recipe as 2 recipes for scoring purposes.

Action cards can only be blocked (so discarded) by the **Block An Opponent Action** card, with the
following exceptions:

- **Universal Ingredients** cannot be discarded by the **Discard up to 2 Prepared Ingredients**
action card, but it gets discarded by the **Discard 1 Cooked Recipe** action card (since it 
participates in the cooking of that recipe as any type of regular ingredient card).
- **Cook Twice** can be discarded by the **Discard 1 Cooked Recipe** action card, to preserve
the recipe it was played with.

### Utensil Cards

Grant **+1 VP** if you cook a recipe that matches the utensil. The bonus VP is once per turn per
utensil card (not per cooked recipe)! So even if multiple recipes match a utensil card you still
only score +1 VP for that utensil. 

Each deck has 3 utensil cards - **Kitchenware**, **Cookware** & **Tableware**.

### Country Card

Explains your deck's special ability and win condition.

## Roles

The game also comes with 6 role cards which can be put in play when 3 or more players are playing.
Each role card has a unique ability that can be used once per turn. The role cards are dealt
randomly to players during the initial setup and then each turn they are moved one player clockwise
so that each turn each player plays a different role. Role cards' abilities cannot be blocked by
action cards! They are played at the start of the turn during the shop phase after players' hands
are filled back to 8 cards.

The role cards are:

- **Chef** - Choose a player to cook 1 **normal** or **hard** recipe this turn. If they manage you
and the player both gain **+1 VP**.
- **Waiter** - Choose a player to cook more than 1 recipe for this turn. If they manage you and the
player both gain **+1 VP**.
- **Dishwasher** - Shuffles a player’s discard pile back into play and have them gain **+1 VP** or
gain **+1 VP** (if the player doesn't want this).
- **Supplier** - Pick a player to either search for 1 card from their deck (then shuffle it) or to
discard 2 cards from their hand; you should do the same action you chose for the player.
- **Critic** - Grants **+1 VP** to an opponent and **+1 VP** to you or **-2 VP** to an opponent
and **-1 VP** to you.
- **Customer** - Demand a player to cook a **normal** or **hard** recipe this turn. If they manage
you both gain **+1 VP**. If not, you both score **-1 VP**.

## Winning the Game

The game ends immediately when:

A player meets their win condition, OR
A player scores 40 VP during their score phase.

## Additional Notes

- Once their deck is empty, a player shuffles their discard pile to form a new draw pile. This
happens even during the **shop** phase because at all times a player must be able to draw up to a
hand of 8 cards!
- Only 1 win condition card can be put per turn. So even if you have multiple win conditions
(i.e. cooked both an entrée and main recipe for France or cooked 3 recipes with **exact** pasta
ingredients for Italy) you can only put 1 win condition card per turn.
- Any recipes cooked with the help of the **Universal Ingredients** or the **Cook Twice** action
cards do not participate in win condition tracking or special ability effects.
