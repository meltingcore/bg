## Overview

Welcome to the ultimate culinary competition! Each player selects a cuisine deck with unique
ingredients, recipes, and abilities. The goal is to outscore your opponents by cooking recipes,
utilizing your deck's special abilities, and achieving your win condition.

## Objective

Be the first to achieve your deck's win condition, OR score 40 Victory Points (VP) to win.

## Setup

1. Select a cuisine deck and place its country card in front of you.
2. Place your deck on your left face down, shuffle it and draw 8 cards for your starting hand.
3. On your right, you will place your discarded cards in a pile face down.
4. On the left of the country card, you will place your win condition cards.
5. On the right of the country card, you will place your utensils cards.
6. Decide the first player randomly and start the game.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of 4 phases. Each phase consists of multiple steps and for each step it is
explicitly mentioned if it is done in **parallel** or in player **order**.

### Shop Phase

1. [**parallel**] Discard up to 3 cards from your hand.
2. [**parallel**] Draw cards from your deck until you have 8 cards in your hand.
3. [**ordered**] Play your role card (if role cards are in play).

### Prepare Phase

1. [**parallel**] Play any ingredient and utensil cards from your hand to your preparation area.
2. [**ordered**] Play any suitable action cards and then discard them.

### Cook Phase

1. [**ordered**] Play any recipes from your hand as long as you meet their ingredient requirements.
You can cook multiple recipes if you have enough ingredients prepared.
2. [**ordered**] Play any suitable action cards and then discard them.

### Score Phase

1. [**ordered**] Score VP for recipes cooked + any special ability effects if eligible and any
utensil cards that match a cooked recipe.
2. [**ordered**] If you have a card(s) from a cooked recipe that are used to track your win
condition, place one of them (of your choosing) in your win condition tracking area.
3. [**parallel**] Discard any cooked recipes along with the ingredient used for them in your
discard pile.

## Card Types

### Ingredient Cards

Can be:

- **Primary** - Used in all recipes.
- **Secondary** - Used in **normal** and **hard** recipes.
- **Optional** - Can be used in a recipe to grant **+1 VP**.

### Recipe Cards

Can be:

- **Easy** - Require 1 **primary** ingredient and grant **+1 VP**.
- **Normal** - Require 1 **primary** and 1 **secondary** ingredient and grant **+2 VP**.
- **Hard** - Require 1 **primary** and 2 **secondary** ingredients and grant **+3 VP**.

Recipes have the following mechanics:

- **Normal** and **Hard** recipes can be cooked for less but score less VP accordingly. For example,
you can cook a **hard** recipe with only 1 secondary ingredient (as **normal** recipe) but you also
score only **2 VP** (as **normal** recipes do). Or cook it only with the primary ingredient as 
**easy** recipe to score only **1 VP**.
- **Hard** recipes when cooked with their ingredient requirements fully covered make all other 
recipes cooked in that turn to score extra **1 VP**. For example if you cook 1 **hard** recipe along
with 2 **easy** recipes that turn, you score extra **2 VP** for the **easy** recipes totalling to
3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **7 VP**. This effect stacks so if you cook 2 **hard** recipes along with 1 
**easy** recipe you score 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **11 VP**.
- Only recipes that were cooked with their ingredient requirements fully covered participate in win
condition tracking. For example with the Italy deck if you cook the **normal** recipe "Fettuccine
Alfredo" with "Fettuccine" as **primary** ingredient only (so as an **easy** recipe) you cannot
place the "Fettuccine" ingredient card in your win condition tracking area.

### Action Cards

Can be played with either offensive or defensive effect. Offensive effects are used to disrupt
opponents. Defensive effects benefit the players themselves. Each deck has the same 10 action cards
as follows (Offensive [O] and Defensive [D]):

- **Blocking** (x3)
  - [O] Block Action - Prevent an opponent from playing an action card. 
  - [D] Block Action - Protect yourself from opponent's action card.
- **Ingredients**
  - [O] Discard Ingredient - Choose 1 prepared ingredient that the opponent should discard.
  - [D] Reuse Ingredient - Prepare 1 ingredient directly from your discard pile.
- **Recipes** 
  - [O] Lose Recipe - Choose 1 cooked recipe of an opponent. Shuffle the recipe card back into
  their draw deck. The ingredients used for the recipe are saved for future use.
  - [D] Reuse Recipe - Take 1 recipe card back from your discard pile to your hand.
- **Win Condition Cards**
  - [O] Disrupt Progress - Shuffle 1 win condition card of an opponent back in their draw pile.
  - [D] Restore Progress - Take 1 card suitable for win condition tracking from your discard pile
  to your hand.
- **Utensils**
  - [O] Break Utensil - Flip a utensil card of an opponent down to disable it.
  - [D] Repair Utensil - Flip a disabled utensil card of yours back up to enable it.
- **Drawing Cards**
  - [O] Discard Cards - Ask an opponent to discard 2 cards of their choosing from their hand.
  - [D] Draw Cards - Draw 2 cards from the draw deck, disregarding the 8 cards hand limit this turn 
  (you still have to discard down to 8 cards at the end of the turn after scoring if necessary).
- **Recipe Scores**
  - [O] Score Less - Make an opponent's cooked recipe to score 1 VP less.
  - [D] Score More - Make a recipe you cooked to score 1 VP more.
- **Playing Hands**
  - [O] Replace Hand - Ask an opponent to replace their hand.
  - [D] Replace Hand - Replace your hand.

Action cards can only be blocked (so discarded) by the **Block An Action** card. The card can be 
used cumulatively (so your opponent can block your block, you theirs, etc.). 

### Utensil Cards

Grant **+1 VP** for each cooked recipe that has a symbol matching the utensil.

Each deck has 3 utensil cards - **Kitchenware**, **Cookware** & **Tableware**.

### Country Card

Explains your deck's special ability and win condition.

## Roles

The game also comes with 6 role cards which can be put in play when 3 or more players are playing.
Each role card has a unique ability that can be used once per turn. The role cards are dealt
randomly to players during the initial setup and then each turn they are moved one player clockwise
so that each turn each player plays a different role. Role cards' abilities cannot be blocked by
action cards! They are played at the start of the turn during the shop phase after players' hands
are filled back to 8 cards.

The role cards are:

- **Chef** - Choose a player to cook 1 **normal** or **hard** recipe this turn. If they manage you
and the player both gain **+1 VP**.
- **Waiter** - Choose a player to cook more than 1 recipe for this turn. If they manage you and the
player both gain **+1 VP**.
- **Dishwasher** - Ask a player to fill up their hand and then discard it. If they do, they gain
**+1 VP**. If they refuse, you gain **+1 VP**.
- **Supplier** - Choose a player to either take any 2 cards from their discard pile or to draw 2
cards less during the **shop** phase (so up to 6 card hand max) this turn. Then you do the same.
- **Critic** - Grants **+1 VP** to an opponent and **+1 VP** to you or **-2 VP** to an opponent
and **-1 VP** to you.
- **Customer** - Demand a player to cook a **normal** or **hard** recipe this turn. If they manage
you both gain **+1 VP**. If not, you both score **-1 VP**.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after the turn in which a player meets its win condition or scores 40 VP in total.
But winning is not immediate! Everybody has to finish their turn and score their VP before the
game ends.

Then to determine the winner, calculate the VP of all players (met win condition counts as 30 VP).
If there is a tie, the one who most recently cooked in real life wins.


## Notes & Clarifications

- Once their deck is empty, a player shuffles their discard pile to form a new draw pile. This
happens even during the **shop** phase because at all times a player must be able to draw up to a
hand of 8 cards!
- Only 1 win condition card can be put per turn! So even if you have multiple win conditions
(i.e. cooked both an **entrée** and **appetizer** recipe for France or cooked 3 recipes with 
**exact** pasta ingredients for Italy) you can still only put the **entrée** card (France) or 1
of the 3 **exact** pasta ingredient cards (Italy) as win condition card.
