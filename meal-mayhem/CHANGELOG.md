# Changelog

## [0.1.1]

FEATURES:

* Added [TODO](TODO.md) list

BUGFIXES:

- **Decks**:
  - **France**:
    - Special ability changed to grant extra VP when cooked adjacent recipes from a 3-course meal
    in the same turn (instead of when fulfilling win condition) cause extra VP were granted very
    rarely otherwise;
    - Win condition was modified to not discard recipes anymore when tracking a course so you should
    have 6 win condition cards to win instead of 2; Change was made so that everyone loses similar
    amount of cards from its deck to track win condition.
  - **Italy**:
    - Special ability was changed to grant **+1 VP** for **normal** and **+2 VP** for **hard**
    recipes since flat **+2 VP** for both was a little too powerful.
    - Win condition tracking now use recipes instead of pasta ingredients as win condition cards in 
    order not to penalize that much players with lack of primary ingredients.
- **Actions**:
  - The 3 action cards benefitting self (**Play Again**, **Universal Ingredient** and
  **Cook With Less**) are removed. Instead, the other action cards (afflicting opponents) are
  adjusted to be a pair of each.
- **Rules**:
  - Score to win by VP adjusted from 30 to 50 as 30 was reached too quickly.
  - Added a rule that specifies that only 1 win condition card can be placed per turn per player
  as otherwise cooking combos can occur that can result in a player meeting half of its win 
  condition in a single turn.
